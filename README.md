Title: Aerial Threat

Setting: This encounter takes place on a winding, narrow mountain path. The sun is blinding and the arid wind howls, carrying a thin veil of dust and sand.

Creatures:

1. **Giant Vultures (Level 2 Creature) x4**: These large, menacing scavengers rule the high skies of the mountain. Driven by hunger, they are likely to attack any travelers who dare to cross their territory. 

Environmental Hazards:

1. **Strong Gusts (Level 1 Hazard)**: The howling wind can suddenly become a fierce gust, potentially causing anyone standing near the edge of the path to lose their footing.

2. **Falling Rocks (Level 1 Hazard)**: The disturbance caused by the vultures or the characters might trigger small rockfalls from the mountain side.

Mechanics: 

The Giant Vultures would prefer to attack from a distance, making use of their superior mobility and the high winds. They dive down to attack, and then retreat back into the air, beyond the reach of most melee weapons.

Strong Gusts can occur at the start of each round. Anyone near the edge must succeed on a Reflex save or be pushed 5 feet towards the edge, potentially falling if they are already at the edge.

Falling Rocks can be triggered when a vulture or a character moves adjacent to the mountain side. A creature in the falling rocks' path must make a Reflex save to avoid being hit and take damage.

Victory Condition: The party defeats all the vultures or manages to drive them off.

Losing Condition: The party is defeated or forced to turn back due to the vultures' assault.

Experience Points: 120 (30 XP for each vulture)
